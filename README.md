# Werewolf
Werewolf in C++

## Status
This is super not done. Like it doesn't work yet, I just want to save my progress on github. I'm still planing this out because for now this is just the engine/logic behind the game. I don;t think the game itself would work very well on one machine, or at least not in the console. So ideally this will be split into a server/client package where the client can register a username when connecting to a server.

## Planned:
- Finish game logic (high priority)
- Add in more roles? (low priority)
- Get networking implemented (med priority)
- Split into server/client (med priority)
- Add OpenGL rendering engine if I decide that playing in the console is terrible (this is low priority and high risk)
